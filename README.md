# COMSC-110
Projects from DVC COMSC-110 class taken in the spring of 2022. This was my first every college computer science class and computer science class that used C++, so I learned a lot during this class. This class started with an introduction to coding and ended with linked-list, recursion, and some simple algorithms as well. 


# NOTICE
Not all my code is included here but a good portion is. I have excluded programs written during test, as well as some homework assignment and lab assignments as well. All graded assignments have had the names of the programs changed to make it difficult for any student to cheat using my code. In addtion, the professor should be using an alorithm to check for code similarity to avoid any cheating as well so copying this code should not be applicable.
